#monsters-rolodex (11/2021)

It's a single-page React application, and it lists a bunch of different monsters as characters inside a card with distinctive names and email addresses.

We can see the monsters and can filter them using the search bar. As the user enters the character name, they will see that it will start filtering out any monster that does not have that specific character in the name and will only show those monster cards which does have them.
